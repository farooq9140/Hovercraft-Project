# Hovercraft-Project
-This project was made for the ENGR 290 course competition in a group of 3.The aim of the competition is to allow students to work in teams in order to design the fastest craft with the least amount of components needed held virtually and in a simulated environment due to COVID. 

-The objectives were to make the hovercraft complete as much of the 4 tracks as possible within 60 seconds for each, with the least amount of components used, and the team that finished the first track in the least amount of time wins the competition. The crafts are to operate autonomously with inputs taken from the ultrasonic sensors to determine location of walls, send the data to the controller, which in return will send the data to the arduino board which will return the output commands back to the controller and make the hovercraft react autonomously by directing the thrust fan and the direction of the hovercraft displacements. 

-The hovercraft was to be designed and modeled on a CAD software or website such as Sketchup or AutoCAD, then exported to CoppeliaSim which will simulate the environments such as the ground, the tracks, the obstacles as well as the craft components such as lift fan, sensors, controller, servos, etc. An arduino controller will be used and programmed to read and send data back and forth with the simulation controller, which will allow the hovercraft to travel autonomously according to what the sensors are reading. We got 3rd place with the least amount of components used.
